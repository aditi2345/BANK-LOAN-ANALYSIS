# Power BI Loan Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This Power BI project provides an interactive and dynamic dashboard for analyzing bank loan data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. Traditional reporting methods often lack depth and real-time insights, which can hinder risk assessment, borrower evaluation, and financial planning. This project overcomes these limitations by offering a comprehensive visualization of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics.  

## Key Features  

- **Executive Summary Dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of critical loan performance metrics, including:  
  - Total Loan Applications with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends  
  - Total Funded Amount and Total Received Amount to track cash flow  
  - Average Interest Rate and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) for financial risk assessment  
  - Loan status breakdown (Good vs. Bad Loans)  

- **Loan Performance Dashboard**: Displays insights into loan repayment trends, risk exposure, and borrower creditworthiness to optimize loan approval strategies.  

- **Demographic & Segmentation Analysis**: Visualizes loan distributions based on:  
  - Geographic location (state-wise data)  
  - Loan purpose (debt consolidation, home improvement, business, etc.)  
  - Homeownership status and employment tenure of borrowers  

- **Good vs. Bad Loan Comparison**: Identifies high-risk loan segments by comparing charged-off vs. fully paid loans, supporting proactive risk management.  
 

## Use Cases  
- Enables bank executives and credit risk teams to make data-driven lending decisions  
- Helps in identifying default risks and optimizing loan approval policies  
- Improves operational efficiency by providing real-time monitoring of loan performance  

This project serves as a valuable resource for financial analysts, risk managers, and banking professionals looking to enhance loan portfolio management using Power BI and data analytics.
